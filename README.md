## Install

```console
$ cargo install xkpwgen
```

Building this tool requires network access because the build script fetches the
wordlist from the EFF (see below).

## Use

Invoke `xkpwgen` to generate five passwords:

```console
$ xkpwgen
veneering hazing aging diner
hypertext repose salvaging barometer
quote parchment boxy hurt
gift womanhood step mammary
october hemstitch darkness agony
```

Use `-l` to change the length of passwords, and `-n` to change the number of
passwords:

```console
$ xkpwgen -l 10 -n 2
paralyses unawake both wish gawk islamist taco charity shorts barmaid
submersed tackle font gentile navy same boxing tartness trodden confined
```

`xkpwgen --words` prints the list of words used in passwords and exists.

See `xkpwgen --help` for more information.
