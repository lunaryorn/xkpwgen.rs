## Install

```console
$ cargo install xkpwgen
```

## Use

Invoke `xkpwgen` to generate five passwords:

```console
$ xkpwgen
gains spate rush dine
stool added split skirt
venom foul slack rubs
leer merit ting slate
cribs flock stars help
```

Use `-l` to change the length of passwords, and `-n` to change the number of
passwords:

```console
$ xkpwgen -l 10 -n 2
goals tray guy mill mint cores focus kudos mares beady
ins hark sodas omit glove goofs spurt mash gait beer
```

See `xkpwgen --help` for more information.

## Words

xkpwgen uses the [pokerware wordlists][1] by Christopher Wellons.  His [blog
post][2] explains in detail how he collected these wordlists.  In essence the
default “formal” wordlist comes from formal publications whereas the alternative
“slang” wordlist collects popular words from Reddit comments.
